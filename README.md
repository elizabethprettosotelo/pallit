What is pallit?
Pallit is a web application designed to help people create and discover matching color palettes and fonts for their projects. It allows a user to generate random combinations of colors and fonts for headings, subheadings, or bodies of text, all of which can be modified and personalized to meet a userâ€™s wants.

Why Was pallit Made?
Coming up with coherent color schemes and matching fonts can be an extremely tedious process, so Pallit makes it easier by simply displaying fonts and colors to the user, allowing them to discover them at a much faster rate than one would normally.


Who Was pallit Made For?
Anyone looking for good fonts and color schemes to use in their project designs.

Tools Used to Make pallit
Pallit was primarily developed in Javascript, Typescript, and CSS, using the Next.js framework with TailwindCSS and Vite .
